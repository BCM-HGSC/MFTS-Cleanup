# minimal_hello_world

## Introduction

Managed File Transfer System (MFTS) has become cluttered with directories that have been within our system. 
This tool that has been created will serve as an email generator along with the ability to archive directories upon the 4 week completion date. 


## Building and Running

This project skeleton can be run in multiple ways:


### Interesting Files

- `pyproject.toml`: Current standard selection build tools
- `setup.py`: Almost empty. Only needed to suppor `pip install -e ...`
- `setup.cfg`: Where *all* of the metadata lives, including version
- `src/__main__.py`: Only necessary if you want to support running without installing.
- `src/minimalhello/__init__.py`: Demonstrates fetching `__version__` from build.
- `src/minimalhello/__main__.py`: Top-level script, supports `python -m minimalhello ...`
